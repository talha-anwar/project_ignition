# projectignition
That's our rocket-building website.

The target is rahtet simple. Visit, read the "About" part, then the "Projects" part and finally go to "Contact". 

The "About" part would tell the viewer about all the things we need to get done and all that other stuff. Then comes the "Projects" part where hopefully we'll give updates about the works in progress and upload photos ig...not use about that for now so commented it out. The "Contact" part is the rather complex part ig...cause the w3spaces template what this html code is coming from had a php code area for getting the information about the person wanting to join the team and send it to us. Honestly i don't know a thing about php and not gonna spend a lot of time and so for now i've just commented out that part and used a bunch of links to directly mail us and give a join request to our discord server. We'll just read the mails and decide if that person is ok for the team and it it's fine then we'll add him to the server.
